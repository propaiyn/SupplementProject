# SupplementProject
 QA Final project with CRUD functionality || Springboot CRUD API || Based around supplements

Why am I doing this project?
--------------------------------

To goal of this project is to show what I have learnt over the whole course and integrate as much of my functional
programming language as well as theory i.e. jira boards into the project. I chose to bas it around supplements as
I did a degree in biomedical science, and I am interested in physiology and medicine so I wanted to bring together
my interests into the project.

How I expected the challenge to go?
------------------------------------

I expected this project to push me to the limits of my knowledge and enable me to learn through practice and
research. I was able to complete the project in a reasonable amount of time, however, there was difficulty along
the way as expected. I was able to get through these difficulties using resources including stackoverflow, baeldung,
java documentation and the QA notes.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
---------------------------------------------

Most of the project went well. I was able to stick to the time constraint through pre-planning and use of the 
jira board. I was able to incorporate most of the extra functionality I wanted to add e.g. path insensitivity
and was able to reach the stretch goals of the project also, which I am extremely pleased with.

Although most things went well, I did face many errors along the way which thankfully I was able to push through.
The only thing I wanted to improve is dealing with errors. If I had more time, I would like to have added more
error handling and exceptions.

Possible improvements
--------------------------

If I had more time, I would like to have added more error handling and exceptions to the project as well as
trying to develop a front end to better the user experience.

Project specialism hand in
------------------------------
In the project specialism hand in, I have added the screenshots of postman, swagger, persistence and coverage
reports of the project.
